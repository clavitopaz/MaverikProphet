# Maverik: Rolling Forecast Model using Prophet
This repository outlines the work conducted on the rolling forecast Prophet model for Maverik by the Here for the Cinnabon team. The presentation of this model won first place in the Fall 2023 MSBA Capstone competition. This repository includes exploratory data analysis, the model proposed to Maverik and insights gained from the experience.

# Business Problem
Maverick needed an accurate daily forecast of sales KPIs for a new store's first year of sales. Achieving this allows for more effective financial planning and accurate ROI documents. This project would be a success if it is able to yield a better forecast than their current model. Stakeholders measured success by seeing if there were improvements to the benchmark RMSE. 

This is a supervised regression problem where the predictors involve both categorical and numerical variables, and the target are four sales metrics. In order to solve this problem, we conducted exploratory data analysis, trained several forecasting models, evaluated models on success metrics and generated predictions using the chosen model.

The deliverable is a predictive model that produces daily sales forecasts for each sales metric. This model considers store features, seasonality, as well as having capability to process new data and re-forecast. This project was executed by Biva Sherchan, Roman Brock, Bhoomika John Pedely and Pablo Zarate.
